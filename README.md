## Challenge

:white_check_mark: 1 - request 3 random dog breeds from the url, https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random

:white_check_mark: 2 - In a row, render images (sized 240px x 240px) of all 3 dog breeds

:white_check_mark: 3 - render the name of the breed, spelled out with no dashes and capitalized first letter of each word in the name. (e.g. "blood-hound" would be "Blood Hound")

## Bonus

:white_check_mark: 1 - make the UI responsive such that, when the screen is too narrow, the dog breeds are rendered in a column

:white_check_mark: 2 - display how many seconds it took to fetch each breed from the API (e.g .012 seconds).  Display it underneath the picture of each breed.

3 - create a separate "DogBreed" component that renders each dog breed.  The DogBreed component should take 3 props: imageUrl, name, and number of seconds to load the data for the given breed. The DogBreed component should get rendered from within the index.js file.
